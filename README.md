# TryItOn - Virtual Try On App

TryItOn is a React Native application that empowers users to virtually try on products before making a purchase. It utilizes augmented reality (AR) technology to create an immersive experience, allowing users to see how different products would look on them in real-time.

## Features

- **Virtual Try On:** Users can select products from the app's inventory and visualize how they would appear on themselves using their device's camera.

- **Product Catalog:** Browse through an extensive collection of products available for virtual try-on, including clothing, accessories, and more.

- **Realistic Rendering:** The app employs advanced AR algorithms to provide a realistic representation of how the selected products fit and look.

- **Adjust and Share:** Users can adjust the position, size, and orientation of virtual products, and even capture and share snapshots of their augmented reality experience.
